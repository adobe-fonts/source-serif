# Source Serif Pro

Source Serif Pro is a set of OpenType fonts to complement the [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) family.
In addition to functional OpenType fonts, this open source repository provides all of the source files that were used to build them using the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO).

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build the binary font files from source, you need to have the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO) installed. The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor applications.

### Building one font

The key to building OTF or TTF fonts is `makeotf`, which is part of the AFDKO toolset. Information and usage instructions can be found by executing `makeotf -h`.

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the OTF and TTF fonts.  
For example, build a binary OTF font for the Regular style like this:

```sh
$ cd Roman/Regular/
$ makeotf -r
```

### Building all fonts

For convenience, a shell script named `build.sh` is provided in the root directory.  
It builds all OTFs and TTFs, and can be executed by typing:

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```
