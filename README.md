Cold storage for a high-contrast heavy master drawn for [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif).

This master was touched again in September 2021, since the stems in the previously proposed d2 master are not heavy enough to work with Kanji ideographs.

This master is compatible with the 0, 1, 2 masters, except glyphs not needed for Source Han Serif â€“ small caps, Cyrillic alts, most superiors, etc.
