version 4.004 created 2021/01/22

	Major changes

	- Add optical sizes (#57)
	  Source Serif now has six weights across five optical sizes, which increases the
	  number of styles from 12 to 60. The variable fonts represent this change through
	  the addition of an opsz axis.

	- Shift text master in design space
      Source Serif’s interpolation setup was conceived in a time before Variable Fonts
      existed, which means that axis coordinates of masters did not necessarily need
      to coincide with instance locations. This led to a setup where the Regular style
      was defined to be slightly off the location of an intermediate master – simply
      because a heavier Regular looked better. 
      In VF context, this approach was a little problematic, because default masters
      are presented in the list of available instances.
      In this release, the intermediate master (SourceSerif_1.ufo) was replaced by
      the Regular instance, and re-established as a new master.
      Effectively, the intermediate master was shifted while increasing its weight.
      Ripple effects across the interpolation space (changes of point coordinates,
      advance widths, kerning values) are small, but they do exist.

	- Change family name (announced in #77)
	  Adding optical sizes required re-assessment of spacing, proportions, and kerning
	  decisions in all masters. Additionally, an intermediate master was shifted
	  to clean up the VF design space.
	  While care was taken to keep the existing styles largely equivalent to previous
	  releases, reflow of existing documents is likely.
	  The “Pro” label originally was attached to OpenType fonts to indicate their
	  extended language coverage. With Source Serif’s character support far exceeding
	  former “Pro” standards, this label does not have much meaning anymore.
	  
	  For these reasons, the decision was made to change the family name from
	  Source Serif Pro to Source Serif 4.
